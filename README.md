# MergeTextFilesInFolder

Goal: To make a visual studio app which will merge multiple text files into one large file.
Check issues to see things that still have to be implemented.

The 1st version with GUI is now working. To use this 1st version follow these instructions:
1 - Pick a file type (only .txt and .xml is supported for now)<br />
2 - Pick the location of the files that you want to have merged. All files with that extension will be merged based upon alphabetical order. For now its best to make sure that theres some form of indexing at the start of your file names.<br />
3 - Pick destination folder for merged file.<br />
4 - Name merged file, do not add an extension as this has already been chosen<br />
5 - Click MERGE.<br />
